# Istio Katas

Exercises for the [Eficode Academy](https://www.eficode.com/academy) Istio course.

## Exercise Overview

The natural order would be:

- [Introducing the setup](000-setup-introduction.md)
- [Basic traffic routing](001-basic-traffic-routing.md)
- [Deployment patterns](002-deployment-patterns.md)
- [Traffic into(Ingress) the mesh](003-ingress-traffic.md)
- [Traffic out(Egress) of the mesh](004-egress-traffic.md)
- [Securing with mutual TLS]()  - Todo
- [Controlling service to service communication]() - Todo
- [Securing access to services]()  - Todo
- [A tour of Istio's metrics]() - Todo
- [??]()

However each exercise, besides the setup introduction, has a 
start folder located beneath it. E.g. `001-basic-traffic-routing/start` that 
allows you to do them in **your** preferred order. 

Do note that there can be multiple exercises per exercise file. 

## How to Read Exercise Files

All exercise files start with an introduction
followed by the actual exercise(s).

A general overview of the exercise(s) is given first,
followed by more detailed step-by-step
instructions. If you want a little challenge, you
can try to read the general steps of the
exercise and do the exercise, if you need more help, take a look at
the **step-by-step** instructions. The step-by-step instructions also explain _why_
some of the steps are done in the way they are in the exercise.

**Each exercise is summarized in bold text at the
beginning.**

- All exercise steps are bulleted. The bulleted
  points summarize the previous paragraphs as
  small individual tasks. **To finish the
  exercise, it's sufficient to read only the
  bulleted steps.** All other text is just
  narrative and explanations as to why things are
  done the way they are.

> Quoted blocks indicate points that are "nice to know" and
> can be safely ignored. They won't affect the
> outcome of the exercise, but generally include
> additional information the training doesn't
> handle.
>
> :bulb: If a quoted paragraph begins with a
> lightbulb, it indicates that it's a hint for the
> exercise step.
